1. Set up exit dates for HMIS projects
	* Use infomration from Stephanie's email

		If a client has no exit date then it can generally be assumed that
		they are still enrolled in the program.

		Here are the exceptions:
		If Project Type =
		·         Day Shelter
		·         Homelessness Prevention
		·         Services Only
		·         Other
		·         Street Outreach
		And Project Exit Date is null,  you can construct an exit date by
		adding 90 days to their Project Start Date or 90 days to their last
		service date (from the Services.csv) , whichever comes later.

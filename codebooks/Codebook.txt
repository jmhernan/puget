_PID's and SSN's_

	pid0 = personal ID from pha and hmis - Alastair's linkage and HMIS ID's
	pid1 = generated pid by Tim within pha and hmis - unique id for each row
	pid2 = generated pid by Tim after df merge - unique id for each row
	ssn_dq =
		1 = 9-digit ssn or HMIS dq == 1
		2 = less than 9 digits or HMIS dq == 2
		3 = NA, all same digit, or HMIS dq == 3
	ssn  = original ssn
	ssn1 = ssn quality == 1 and 9 digits
	dob1 = dob that is not in the list of very frequent (i.e. "bad") DOB's

## Script: puget/panel_data/eda.r

	hh_id = household ID:
				For PHA, `hhold_id_new` - unique household ID assigned by
						Alastair.
				For HMIS, `RelationshipToHoH` - field found in HMIS dataframe
	order = the collapsed order of agency
				"CENSORED [agency]" means there is no extra info on agency

## Definitions

* HMIS.
	* Some households have a similar entry date to a PHA and NA exit date in HMIS. In many cases, this is labeled as a PH - Housing with services option.
	* Null end dates:

		If a client has no exit date then it can generally be assumed that they are still enrolled in the program.

		Here are the exceptions:
		If Project Type =
		·         Day Shelter
		·         Homelessness Prevention
		·         Services Only
		·         Other
		·         Street Outreach
		And Project Exit Date is null,  you can construct an exit date by adding 90 days to their Project Start Date or 90 days to their last service date (from the Services.csv) , whichever comes later.
		We don’t typically construct exit dates for any other program types.
